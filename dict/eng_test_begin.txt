My name is Raymond
Gold and I'm a well-kn
own dealer. I was born
too many years ago in
Upper Street, Islingt
on. Everybody reckons
me in the London markets
and I have a good reputation 
in Manchester and the provinces.
I have bought and sold, been the
middleman, an agent, an art representative,
a professional mentor, a tour guide,
a spiritual bridge-builder. 
These days I call
myself a cultural speculator.
But, you won't like it, the more 

familiar word for my profession, as
I practised it until recently, is scalper.
This kind of language is just another way of
isolating the small businessman and making what
he does seem sleazy while the stockbroker dealing
in millions is supposed to be legitimate. But I
don't need to convince anyone today that there's 
no sodding justice.
'Scalping' is risky. What you do is invest in 
tickets on spec and hope to make a timely sale
when the market for them hits zenith. Any kind
of ticket, really, but mostly shows. I've never
seen anything offensive about getting the maximum 
possible profit out of an American matron with more 
money than sense who's anxious to report home with
the right items ticked off the beento list. We've 
all seen them rushing about in their overpriced limos
and mini-buses, pretending to be individuals: Thursday:
Changing-of-the-Guard, Harrods, Planet Hollywood, Royal
Academy, Tea-At-the-Ritz, Cats. It's a sort of tribal dance 
they all feel compelled to perform. If they don't perform it, 
they feel inadequate. Saturday: Tower of London, Bucket of Blood,
Jack-the-Ripper talk, Sherlock Holmes Pub, Sherlock Holmes tour,
Madame Tussaud's, Covent Garden Cream Tea, Dogs. These are people 
so traumatised by contact with strangers that their only security 
lies in these rituals, these well-blazed trails and familiar chants.
It's my job to smooth their paths, to make them exclaim how pretty
and wonderful and elegant and magical it all is. The street people
aren't a problem. They're just so many charming Dick Van Dykes.
Americans need bullshit the way koala bears need eucalyptus leaves.
They've become totally addicted to it. They get so much of it back
home that they can't survive without it. It's your duty to help them
get their regular fixes while they travel. And when they make it back 
after three weeks on alien shores, their friends, of course, are always
glad of some foreign bullshit for a change.
